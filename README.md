# Improved YOLOv5 for Early Parkinson's Disease Detection

This repository contains an enhanced YOLOv5 model for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease from medical images. The improvements focus on increasing detection accuracy and reducing false positives and negatives.

## Features

- **Coordinate Attention (CA) Mechanism**: Enhances feature focus by integrating spatial information into channel attention.
- **Dynamic Depthwise Convolutions**: Improves image representation in the Neck layer.
- **Decoupled Head Layers**: Increases detection effectiveness by separating classification and localization tasks.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Improved-YOLOv5-Parkinsons.git
   cd Improved-YOLOv5-Parkinsons
